# Community Standards and Health Files

Maintaining a healthy and welcoming open source project is essential for attracting contributors, ensuring security, and fostering a collaborative environment. This document explains the purpose of key community health files and resources, and why they matter for your project.

## What Are Community Standards?

Community standards are a set of recommended files and practices that help open source projects be more accessible, secure, and welcoming. GitHub and the open source community encourage projects to include these files to:
- Guide contributors on how to participate
- Set expectations for behavior and contributions
- Provide clear instructions for reporting issues and vulnerabilities
- Build trust and transparency

For more, see the [GitHub Community Profile documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories) and [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/).

## Key Community Health Files

### 1. `SECURITY.md`
- **Purpose:** Provides guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities and describes how the project handles security issues.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures vulnerabilities are reported responsibly and handled confidentially, protecting users and contributors.
- **What it typically includes:**
  - Contact information for reporting vulnerabilities
  - Supported versions
  - Responsible disclosure policy

### 2. `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Purpose:** Outlines how to contribute to the project, including submitting issues, pull requests, and following code style guidelines.
- **Why it matters:** Lowers the barrier for new contributors, sets clear expectations, and helps maintain code quality.
- **What it typically includes:**
  - Steps for submitting issues and pull requests
  - Code style and documentation requirements
  - Community standards and behavior

### 3. Pull Request Template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
- **Purpose:** Provides a checklist and structure for contributors when submitting pull requests.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures all necessary information is provided, making it easier for maintainers to review and merge contributions.
- **What it typically includes:**
  - Description of changes
  - Type of change (bug fix, feature, etc.)
  - Checklist for testing, documentation, and code quality

### 4. Other Recommended Files
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:** Sets expectations for behavior and helps build a welcoming community.
- **`LICENSE`:** Clearly states the legal terms for using, modifying, and distributing the project.
- **`README.md`:** Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage, and links to community files.

## Why Are These Files Important?
- **Encourage Contributions:** Clear guidelines and templates make it easier for newcomers to get involved.
- **Improve Security:** A security policy ensures vulnerabilities are reported and handled safely.
- **Build Trust:** Transparency about how the project is managed and how issues are handled builds confidence among users and contributors.
- **Meet GitHub Community Profile Checklist:** Projects with these files are more likely to attract contributors and be featured in searches.
